Intro
=====

xs is a wrapper for the Crossroads I/O library (http://www.crossroads.io/).

License
=======

xs uses different licenses for different parts of the code.

The 'core' of xs (located in xs.tcl) is licensed under LGPLv3. This just
means that if you make any changes to how that code works, you must release
those changes under the LGPL. If you just use xs, then you can use any
license you want for your own code. Check COPYING.LESSER for more info.

The restrictions imposed by the LGPL make no sense for the 'non-core'
functionality in xs (derivative code must also be LGPL or GPL), especially
for examples, so all 'non-core' code is relicensed under the more permissive BSD
(specifically Modified BSD aka New BSD aka 3-clause BSD), where possible. This
means that you can copy this code and build your own apps without needing to
license your own code with the LGPL or GPL. Check COPYING.BSD for more info.

Building
========

Requirements:

- Crossroads I/O from git repository at

    https://github.com/crossroads-io/libxs

  When you want to link 0MQ to the Tcl package statically on Linux, make sure to
  set the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables to -fPIC before running
  configure.

- Tcl 8.5 or 8.6

- Critcl 3

On linux and windows:

- run "tclsh build.tcl"

Type "tclsh build.tcl --help" for more information.

The package can be linked against Crossroads I/O statically or
dynamicallly. Default is dynamic. Use the -static option to choose static
linking.

Usage
=====
